# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

***

[Video Game Sales Prediction (Linear Regression and XGBoost)](https://github.com/ImVikashKr/Video-game-sales-prediction)

<img src="images/vg.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:**  In this project the aim is to predict the video game sale based on the various features collected and stored in a dataset.we will use the linear regression method to analyse the problem and use various modeling technique to find which model provides the better accuracy 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Predict the Video Game sales prediction with an accuracy of 98.75%
- Used the Linear regression model to find the accuracy 
- Also used XGBoost Algorithm two compare the two model

[Heart Failure Prediction (Classification Machine Learning)](https://github.com/ImVikashKr/Heart-failure-prediction)

<img src="images/heartfailure.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:**  Using Various machine learning algorithm to predict heart disease prediction in Python, We used logistic  Regression,  KNN, Random Forest etc as a classifier forHeart Desease prediction

**Quantifiable result:**  We could predict Employee Attrition using a logistic regression model. With accuracy of 85%
- The accuracy of the KNN model is 71% Tat k=6
- Naive bayes accuracy is 83%
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns.
- The selected best model is based on train and test performance.

[Paris House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)](https://github.com/ImVikashKr/Paris-House-price-prediction)

<img src="images/houseprice.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project the aim is to predict the house price of paris based on the various features collected and stored in a dataset.we will use the linear regression  and fandom forest method to analyse the problem and use various modeling technique to find which model provides the better accuracy

**Quantifiable result:**  We could use regression and random forest which helps us to predict the Score. Result 99% accuracy using random forest 
- Used Random ForestXGBRegressor and Linear regression to predict the house price
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns

[Diabetese prediction ](https://github.com/ImVikashKr/Diabetese-prediction)

<img src="images/Diabetese.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** In this project we will try to find wheather a person hhas diabetes or not based on various health conditions. This is a classsification problem hence we will try to predict the answwer using KNN or NB model technique

**Quantifiable result:**  We could use regression, which helps us to predict weather the person having diabetese or not with . 99.7 % accuracy
- Data visualization to see correlation factors
- Machine learning: Naive Bayes,  Logistic  regression Random forest, XGBooster.
- The selected best model is based on the train and test performance
